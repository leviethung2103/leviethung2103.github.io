Hello! Iâ€™m Le Viet Hung. To talk about myself, I love listening to music, traveling, and photography. I have a great interest in Artificial Intelligence and am pursuing my career in the same. 

I am a Machine Learning Engineer at [EST Rouge]() working with global client teams to build state-of-the-art products. I have worked in the domains of Recommendation System, Optimization Problem and Face Recognition Problems.

My inquisitive nature, craving for knowledge, and longing for novelty and innovation strengthen my passion to work and learn daily to increase my knowledge horizon.

I am mostly into tech and so, my blog will be a reflection of whatever new thing I learn about tech.

Thank you for visiting my blog.
